### Format  
`Task directory structure`  
**Images** directory is to contain the test images. At present there are 4 images which were given at the time of briefing.  
**Output** directory is to contain the output images which the scripts will generate. Output images have been named suitably.  
I've tried to make the python scripts as much uniform as possible. The files:  
T1_20CS10011_dijkstra.py  
T1_20CS10011_astar-admissible.py  
T1_20CS10011_astar-compromised.py  
T1_20CS10011_astar\_euclid.py  
T1_20CS10011_astar\_manhattan.py  
T1_20CS10011_astar\_diagonal.py  
`Running the scripts`
On running each script if the image is found (placed in **Images** directory) user will be asked to input the _case_ he want to proceed with 
(input **1** for case 1: no diagonal movements and input **2** for case 2: inclusive diagonal movements.  
>Accordingly the output will be shown and an ouput image will be stored in the **Output** directory with the respective name.
